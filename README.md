ipv6he.net_updater
==================

a c# client for updating the ipv4 address for the ipv6 tunnel provider Hurricane Internet 


if you have mono installed, you can easily compile from source: 

<pre>mcs program.cs</pre>

then execute

<pre>mono program.exe</pre>


If you are on linux, you can set up a cron job for a scheduled run, on Windows you can use the at command or Task Scheduler to run the app as a job on regular basis (for me it's hourly)
